### TCP/IP

The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a suite of communication protocols used to connect network devices on the Internet.

The **TCP layer** handles the assembling of a message or file into packets (a small unit of data), which are then transmitted over the Internet. At the receiving end, the TCP layer is then responsible for reassembling the packets into the original message.

The **IP layer** handles the destination address of each individual packet. A computer on the network that receives a packet will look at the destination IP address of packets, and if they are not the destination address, they forward the message onto the next most logical destination.

### Secure Sockets Layer

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a **security protocol** used to establish an ecrypted link between a client and a server (i.e. a web browser and a web server).

An **SSL certificate** is necessary for creating an SSL connection. When visiting a website that uses SSL for encryption using a browser, the web browser will form a connection with the web server after inspecting and approving of the SSL certificate. Then, the browser and server will have a secure binding connection that ensures that only the two entities can see or access information sent back and forth.
