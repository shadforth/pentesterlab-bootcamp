### DNS zone transfers

A DNS zone transfer is a type of DNS transaction. It is used by administrators as a method to replicate DNS databases across a group of DNS servers. The primary DNS server sends a DNS "zone" to secondary DNS servers. This allows for more than one DNS server able to handle requests about a particular zone. In a zone transfer, there is a master DNS server, and one or more slave DNS servers. The slave servers must ask the master server for a copy of the records for that zone.

Why is this important? Because the data contained in a particular DNS zone may contain sensitive information, such as details about infrastructure and existing subdomains. If a DNS server is misconfigured, this gives adversaries the opportunity to make a DNS zone transfer attack. The adversary "pretends" to be a slave DNS server and can request – what could be – sensitive information from the master server.

### Virtual hosting

Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names on a single server. For example, it is possible to have `www.example1.com` and `www.example2.com` running on a single machine.

There are three types of virtual hosting: **IP-based virtual hosting**, **name-based virtual hosting**, and **port-based virtual hosting**.

#### IP-based

With IP-based virtual hosting, each website on a single server has a **unique** IP address.

An example configuration of virtual IP-based hosts on an Apache server is outlined below.

```
<VirtualHost 172.20.30.40:80>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@example1.com
  DocumentRoot "/www/vhosts/example1/"
  ServerName "www.example1.com"
  ErrorLog "/www/logs/example1/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 172.20.30.50:80>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@example2.com
  DocumentRoot "/www/vhosts/example2/"
  ServerName "www.example2.com"
  ErrorLog "/www/logs/example2/"
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Name-based

With name-based virtual hosting, a single IP address may have several host names. For example, a server could be receiving requests for two domains `www.mysite1.com` and `www.mysite2.com`, both of which resolve to the same IP address.

#### Port-based

Port-based virtual hosting involves explicitly binding each website to a unique port number and IP address.

## Hands on

- [X] Install PHP on a virtual machine and write a script that echoes back the parameter in a URL
- [X] Install MySQL on a virtual machine and create a script that retrieves information from the URL
- [X] Create a page that sends data to itself using a POST request
