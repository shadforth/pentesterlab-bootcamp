### Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is an *internet standard* which allows email formatting to support features such as:
- text characters that aren't ASCII
- non-text attachments (video, photo, etc.)
- message bodies with multiple parts
- header information that is not ASCII.

The header is used to declare the version of the Internet message body format standard in use. It used to be RFC 822. MIME was originally designed for SMTP, but it still serves important functions in communication protocols, such as HTTP.
